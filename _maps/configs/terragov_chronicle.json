Often employed for census duties and interstellar exploration, the Chronicle is also a favorite of Evidenzkompanien, employed often for intelligence operations. With this fact in mind, Chronicle-class vessels are often placed under increased scrutiny by patrols, somewhat mitigating their effectiveness as a spymaster's tool.",
