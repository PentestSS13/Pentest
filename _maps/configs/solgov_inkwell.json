Additionally, they are often commissioned and sold to non-Terran parties for use in interstellar shipping. \n The usage of the Inkwell-class to move illicit or untracked cargo is known by any seasoned (or even half-cooked) port authority; \"...such regrettable actions by an outlier minority are mere part-and-parcel of the realities of interstellar shipping,\" goes the official reply.",
